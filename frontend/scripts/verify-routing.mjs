/**
 * Routing guard — runs as part of `npm run build`, before anything deploys.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This exists because of a real outage: the SPA catch-all rewrite pointed at
 * `/index.html` while `cleanUrls: true` was set. Vercel 308-redirects
 * /index.html -> /, so the rewrite resolved to a redirect instead of a document
 * and every client-only route hard-404'd — /login, /director/*, /post/:uuid,
 * /member/:uuid. The 15 prerendered .html routes kept returning 200 (Vercel
 * checks the filesystem before rewrites), so the site looked healthy from the
 * homepage and the breakage was only reported days later as "the HoD desk 404s".
 *
 * A live smoke test can't catch this at build time (the new deployment doesn't
 * exist yet — see scripts/smoke.mjs for the post-deploy half). But the bug is
 * fully determined by vercel.json, so it can be caught statically, here, and
 * fail the build instead of shipping.
