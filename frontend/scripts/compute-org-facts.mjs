 * compute-org-facts.mjs — writes src/lib/orgFacts.ts from live Supabase data
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Run:  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... node scripts/compute-org-facts.mjs
 *       (also runs as an early step of `npm run build`, see package.json)
 * Out:  frontend/src/lib/orgFacts.ts   (checked in — regenerated, not hand-edited)
 *       frontend/index.html            (four hardcoded figures patched — see patchIndexHtml)
 *       frontend/public/llms.txt       (two hardcoded figures patched — see patchLlmsTxt)
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ───────────────
 * The live site shipped FOUR different values for "drives/projects completed"
 * at once (450+ in index.html's JSON-LD, 512+ in an older metaConfig/AboutPage
 * pass, 534+ in another, 550+ in the live Marquee) because the number was
 * retyped by hand at every call site and nobody could tell which one was true.
 * `docs/BRAND_VOICE.md` §3 is explicit: "never invent, round up, or improve a
 * number." The fix isn't picking one of the four — it's removing hand-typed
 * statistics from components entirely and computing every one, here, from the
 * database that actually knows.
 *
 * CONTRACT (changelog/21-org-facts.md §21.2)
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *   1. Connect with the SERVICE-ROLE key. This script never ships to the
 *      client bundle (it's a build-time .mjs under scripts/, not imported by
 *      any src/ file), and the key is never committed — see the fail-soft
 *      branch below for what happens when it's absent.
 *   2. One `count`-only query per computed fact (`head: true, count: 'exact'`)
 *      — no rows cross the wire to count them.
 *   3. Round DOWN, never up, when a fact is displayed as a "+" figure. See
 *      `displayCount` — it's exported from the generated file so every call
 *      site uses the SAME rounding, not a hand-rolled one per component.
 *   4. FAIL THE BUILD on any query error. A stale orgFacts.ts (last known-good,
 *      already committed) is better than a wrong one, so: don't write, exit 1.
 *      Never write a 0 for a query that errored.
 *   5. Log a diff against the previously-committed file. A >20% move in either
 *      direction is either real growth or a broken filter, and both deserve a
 *      loud line in the build log, not a silent commit.
 *
 * WHAT COULD NOT BE COMPUTED (verify against BRAND_VOICE.md §3 before "fixing")
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   - schoolsRepresented: `schools` exists as a table but holds ZERO rows, and
 *     every one of the 1,317 active `members` has `school_id IS NULL` (checked
 *     live 2026-09-05). The FK exists; nothing has ever populated it. This
 *     ships as `null` rather than the honest-but-useless "0 schools".
 *   - clothesDistributedKg: still not derivable, and now a CONSTANT the owner
 *     set (2,000 kg). `key_statistic` matches 55 rows on /cloth|kg/, but only
 *     14 say "clothes" (2 of them RANGES), 15 are BOOKS, 25 are unlabelled
 *     "N Kgs collected", and 1 is a child count. Summing that would fold books
 *     into a clothes figure. See the CONSTANTS block.
 *
 * CORRECTED 2026-09-06 — this section used to claim dogs were not derivable
 * either ("no table backs either claim at all"). That was WRONG, and it is a
 * good example of why §21 says to check the database rather than the comment:
 * `welfare_projects.key_statistic` records a per-drive figure for all 58
 * dog-feeding drives, every one with a parseable leading integer. It is now
 * DERIVED as `dogMealsServed` (see computeDogMeals). It is published as MEALS,
 * not as distinct dogs, because 58 drives around Kolkata necessarily feed
 * overlapping populations — see that function's header.
 *
 * FAIL-SOFT vs FAIL-HARD — read this before wiring a CI secret
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `generate-sitemap.mjs` (the other build-time DB script in this repo) can
 * fail soft on a missing key because its anon key has a literal, safe,
 * checked-in fallback — anon keys are meant to be public. A SERVICE-ROLE key
 * can never have that fallback; committing one is a severe secret leak. So:
 *
 *   - Key ABSENT  → this is treated as "this environment doesn't have it yet"
 *     (a contributor's laptop, a fork, or a Vercel project where nobody has
 *     added SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to Production/Preview env vars yet),
 *     NOT as an error. Warn loudly, leave the committed orgFacts.ts exactly as
 *     it is, exit 0. The alternative — hard-failing every build that lacks the
 *     secret — would turn "nobody has provisioned this key in Vercel yet" into
 *     "the site cannot deploy," which is a self-inflicted outage for a content
 *     freshness concern. See the "Does CI exist?" answer in the PR notes.
 *   - Key PRESENT but a query throws → this is the real failure §21.2.4 means.
 *     Fail hard, exit 1, do not touch orgFacts.ts.

 *
 * The live site once shipped four different values for "drives completed" at
 * once (450+ in index.html's JSON-LD, 512+, 534+, 550+ elsewhere) because the
 * number was retyped by hand at every call site. \`docs/BRAND_VOICE.md\` §3:
 * "never invent, round up, or improve a number." The fix is this file: every
 * public statistic is computed from the database, once, at build time, and
 * every component imports it instead of retyping it.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF FACT, kept in clearly separate blocks, and never mixed:
 *   1. COMPUTED — read live from Supabase by scripts/compute-org-facts.mjs on
 *      every build. Each one below carries the query that produced it.
 *   2. CONSTANT — a founding date, a registration number, or (for three
 *      claims with no system of record at all — dogs fed, clothes
 *      distributed, Paradox 3.0's date) \`null\` until a named human sets one.
 *      These can never be "recomputed" to something wrong, so they live in
 *      the generator script's CONSTANTS block, not derived here.
 *
 * Historical context this file also carries forward (kept from the
 * hand-written version that predated the generator, decisions still in
 * force):
 *
 *   • Founding year said "est. 2023" on the login page and "2021" in eleven
 *     other places, including the About page's own founding narrative. It was
 *     wrong on the single page where someone decides whether the org is real.
 *
 *   • Approval time told an applicant "usually 24 hours, sometimes 48" on
 *     /register and "within a week" on /pending — the very next screen. A
 *     fifteen-year-old signs up, is promised a day, and is told a week before
 *     they've finished their first session. Resolved to the SLOWER, majority
 *     figure: six public surfaces already said "within a week," and a promise
 *     you beat is better than one you miss.
 *
 * NOTE: APPROVAL_TIME is the *member* approval SLA. The contact-form reply
 * time is a different promise and lives with the contact copy; don't merge them.

 * found by diffing dist/index.html's rendered tags against metaConfig.ts's
 * `home` description after a full `npm run build` and noticing they disagreed,
 * then a full re-read of the file turning up two more in the Organization block.

 * dogMealsServed — the one DERIVED fact that is a sum over text, not a count.

 * Why it is not in JOBS: every other fact is `count: 'exact', head: true`, so
 * no rows cross the wire. This one has to read 58 short strings, because the
 * figure lives inside `welfare_projects.key_statistic` free text ("45 Dogs
 * fed"). That is a deliberate, bounded exception to contract rule 2 — one
 * narrow column, one filter, ~58 rows — not a licence to fetch tables.
 *
 * Why the metric is "meals served" and not "dogs fed": the records are
 * per-drive counts across 58 separate street-feeding drives around Kolkata,
 * which necessarily feed OVERLAPPING dog populations. Summing them gives
 * feedings, not distinct animals. Publishing "3,265 dogs fed" would assert
 * 3,265 individual dogs, which the data cannot support — BRAND_VOICE.md §3:
 * "never invent, round up, or improve a number." Ruled 2026-09-06: publish it
 * as dog MEALS, which is exactly what was counted.
 *
 * Two of the 58 rows read "10+ dogs and cows were fed biscuits", so a small
 * number of cow feedings are inside this total. At ~20 of ~3,265 that is well
 * under the rounding floor displayCount() applies, so it cannot move the
 * published figure — noted here so nobody rediscovers it as a bug.
