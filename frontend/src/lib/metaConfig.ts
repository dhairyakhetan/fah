  // it cannot read the database at build time and cannot update without a
  // deploy. On 2026-09-21 the cricket card advertised a ₹9,000 pot against a
  // real 7,500 and pickleball ₹6,000 against a real 5,000, on the two links

  // here to match the database.

  // Drifted again on 2026-09-21: the cricket fee moved from 2,400 to 2,100
  // at the desk and this string kept advertising the old one.
