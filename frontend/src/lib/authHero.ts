/**
 * The pure mapping at the centre of the auth funnel's contextual hero:
 * `resolveAuthHero(intent, counts) -> AuthHero`. One function, one place,
 * that owns "which intent gets which look" - see auth/AuthHero.tsx for the
 * component that renders what this returns, and lib/authIntent.ts for where
 * the intent itself comes from.
 *
 * Every hue used here is a background FILL, so text colour is resolved with
 * `stickerTextHex()` - the same measured-contrast function components/
 * Sticker.tsx uses - rather than one of the `--*-ink` tokens, which are tuned
 * for the opposite case (a hue used as text colour on a light ground). Do not
 * swap these two; `--welfare-ink` on `--welfare` itself has never been
 * measured for that direction.
