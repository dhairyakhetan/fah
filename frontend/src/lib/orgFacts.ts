/**
 * Facts about AquaTerra that appear in user-facing copy.
 *
 * GENERATED. Do not edit by hand. Written by scripts/compute-org-facts.mjs.
 * Regenerate (`npm run org-facts`, or let `npm run build` do it), do not patch.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (changelog/21-org-facts.md)
 *
 * The live site once shipped four different values for "drives completed" at
 * once (450+ in index.html's JSON-LD, 512+, 534+, 550+ elsewhere) because the
 * number was retyped by hand at every call site. `docs/BRAND_VOICE.md` §3:
 * "never invent, round up, or improve a number." The fix is this file: every
 * public statistic is computed from the database, once, at build time, and
 * every component imports it instead of retyping it.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF FACT, kept in clearly separate blocks, and never mixed:
 *   1. COMPUTED — read live from Supabase by scripts/compute-org-facts.mjs on
 *      every build. Each one below carries the query that produced it.
 *   2. CONSTANT — a founding date, a registration number, or (for three
 *      claims with no system of record at all — dogs fed, clothes
 *      distributed, Paradox 3.0's date) `null` until a named human sets one.
 *      These can never be "recomputed" to something wrong, so they live in
 *      the generator script's CONSTANTS block, not derived here.
 *
 * Historical context this file also carries forward (kept from the
 * hand-written version that predated the generator, decisions still in
 * force):
 *
 *   • Founding year said "est. 2023" on the login page and "2021" in eleven
 *     other places, including the About page's own founding narrative. It was
 *     wrong on the single page where someone decides whether the org is real.
 *
 *   • Approval time told an applicant "usually 24 hours, sometimes 48" on
 *     /register and "within a week" on /pending — the very next screen. A
 *     fifteen-year-old signs up, is promised a day, and is told a week before
 *     they've finished their first session. Resolved to the SLOWER, majority
 *     figure: six public surfaces already said "within a week," and a promise
 *     you beat is better than one you miss.
 *
 * NOTE: APPROVAL_TIME is the *member* approval SLA. The contact-form reply
 * time is a different promise and lives with the contact copy; don't merge them.
