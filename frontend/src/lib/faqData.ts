// Single source of truth for FAQ content shown on both /faq and /volunteer.
// The two pages used to hand-maintain separate arrays that answered several
// of the same questions ("is there a fee," "how does approval work") in
// different wording - not contradictory today, but the same failure shape
// that already caused a real, documented drift bug once (see orgFacts.ts:
// founding-year and approval-time claims disagreeing across pages before
// being centralized there). Consolidating here closes that risk before it
// repeats.
//
// `context` marks which page(s) a question belongs on:
//  - 'faq'      -> FAQPage only
//  - 'handbook' -> VolunteerHandbookPage only
//  - 'both'     -> genuinely the same question on both pages (fee, approval
//                  time) - one wording, shown on both.

Anyone can volunteer for welfare drives and community activities. Team AQ (150-200 members) is the active core: selected via application, assigned to specific departments, expected to show up consistently.`, context: 'faq', cluster: 'joining' },
  { id: 'what-will-i-do', q: 'What will I actually do?', a: 'Depends on your department. Events team runs Paradox, Disco Diwali, and Starry Nights. Welfare team runs teaching workshops and Sundarbans relief trips. Social Media team runs the Instagram and content. Collabs team handles school and NGO partnerships. Crftd handles the streetwear brand. You pick what fits you.', context: 'faq', cluster: 'joining' },

  // caused a real drift bug (24h vs a week vs "usually a week") can't drift
  // again even though the two answers differ in scope/depth (this one is a
  // quick timing answer; the handbook's covers what happens after approval)
  // - not merged into one 'both' entry, since the handbook's version has
  // real extra detail (community platform access, additional screening for
  // Labs/Director-track) a merge would have silently dropped.

  { id: 'time-commitment', q: "What's the time commitment?", a: "Minimum 4–6 hours per month. Most active volunteers put in 10–15 hours. Drives are usually on weekends.
