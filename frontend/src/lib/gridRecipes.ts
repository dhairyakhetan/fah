   SECTION 34 · the grid host, phase one
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   The ink greeting block hosts ONE of the 38 recipes in
   `AQ Adaptive Grids.dc.html`. Six ship in phase one, plus the fallback,
   evaluated FIRST-MATCH-WINS top to bottom, exactly like the feed card chooser
   in lib/feedShape.ts.

     G12  drive signed up for, within 14 days
     G04  no upcoming drive, has attended before
     G27  leader with pending work on their desk
     G01  brand new, account under 7 days
     G21  something the member themselves submitted is still waiting
     G09  a trail to pick up: unread notifications, or saved posts
     G30  leader, desk clear
     G19  attended nothing, account older than 7 days
     G33  on a break (break_start set, break_end in the future)
     G38  always matches

   G33 sits last DELIBERATELY: a member on a break who has also signed up for a
   drive should see the drive, because they chose it.

   ── 2026-09-07, WHY THE ORDER MOVED AND WHY THREE IDS ARE NEW ──────────────
   The owner (a super_admin, with a live desk) was seeing G38: the greeting and
   a single map tile. Diagnosed against the live database, two causes stacked.

   (a) STRUCTURAL. `queueDepth` was never assembled by any host - HomePage's
       own comment said so - so G27's `queue.total > 0` could not be true for
       ANYBODY, ever. Nothing summed a director's waiting rows.
   (b) THE OWNER'S ROW. `members.approved_at` is NULL on the super_admin row
       that logs in most recently (5 of the 17 leader rows are null; 1358 of
       1375 member rows are). `daysSinceApproved` is therefore undefined, so
       G19 (`(daysSinceApproved ?? 0) > 7`) is false and G01 (`typeof === 
       'number'`) is false. With G12/G04 needing drive data that does not exist
       (`drive_attendance` holds 0 rows; `welfare_projects` has 0 dates ahead
       of today) and no break set, every predicate above the floor missed.

   G27 also MOVED, from fifth to third. It used to sit below G19, and G19
   matches nearly every member alive today because `drive_attendance` is empty
   - so a leader with a full desk would have been shown "find something to do"
   instead of their queue even once (a) was fixed. A leader's waiting rows
   outrank a generic browse prompt. G12 and G04 stay above it: a drive they
   personally chose still wins over the desk, which is the same rule that puts
   G33 last.

   G21 and G09 sit above G19 for the same reason - a concrete thing waiting on
   this person beats "go and find something" - and below G01, because a
   week-old account has no trail to pick up. G30 sits below both so that a
   leader with a clear desk still gets their own reminders first, and above
   G19 so a leader is never dropped into a member-onboarding recipe.

   THE ids G21, G09 and G30 are new assignments in section 34's own numbering
   (which already re-assigns the canvas's ids - see ON THE RECIPE IDs below).
   They do not correspond to the canvas rows of those numbers.

   THE FOUR NON-NEGOTIABLES (section 34, restated because every visual pass so
   far has drifted off one of them):
     1. the grid lives INSIDE the ink greeting block, never as its own section
     2. row unit is 72px, FIXED. 58px was derived before the tile label was
        legible and clipped 13 of 16 tiles. Do not re-derive it.
     3. tiles are rgba(244,239,224,.07) on ink, with EXACTLY ONE solid hue tile
        per recipe. The wash is what makes the hue tile read as the answer.
     4. icons only on tiles spanning two or more rows. A 20px icon in a 72px
        tile leaves no room for its own label.
   Plus: every recipe ends with the full-width map tile, so there is always a
   way out. And a figure the host cannot resolve renders as a dashed live
   marker, never a zero. A zero is a claim.

   ON THE RECIPE IDs. `AQ Adaptive Grids.dc.html` numbers its 38 recipes by a
   different scheme: its G12 is "clear desk", its G19 is "break active", its
   G33 is "ranking down", its G38 is "partial failure". CHANGELOG-REDESIGN
   section 34 and docs/FEED-ALGORITHM.md section 4 re-assign the six ids to the
   member states above, and they agree with each other. Section 34 supersedes
   the canvas chooser (its own words), so the ids here follow section 34.
   Recorded in CHANGELOG_SEC10_34.md so nobody "fixes" one to match the other.

   NO NEW ENDPOINT. Every predicate reads from the context object the home page
   already has. This file fetches nothing and imports no Supabase client.

   * 0 rows, so it rendered `0h` to people with years of drives behind them -
   * paper check-in predates the 2026-08-31 digital sheet. A figure that is
   * always wrong is worse than no figure. All three are replaced by two tiles
