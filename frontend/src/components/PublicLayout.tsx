// JS module graph, not file boundaries - a statically-imported AQFooter (as
// this was before) pulls both stylesheets into whatever chunk PublicLayout
// itself lands in, which is the main entry chunk since PublicLayout wraps
// nearly every route and is never lazy itself. Confirmed live: before this
// change, `aq-wall-headline`/`aq-activity-track` etc. shipped inside
// dist/assets/index-*.css (the render-blocking critical CSS on every
// route) - exactly the "defeats the entire point of 14.0" failure mode
// 14.7 warns about, despite the CSS already living in its own file. Making
// the component itself lazy is the same mechanism already proven by
// routes/projects.css and routes/director.css (docs/PERFORMANCE_AUDIT_2026_07_31.md
// P0-2's own words: "move each block into a stylesheet imported by the only
// component that renders those classes") and by the two modals above in
// this same file. fallback={null}: the footer is below the fold on every
// route (14.0), so there is nothing to skeleton while its tiny chunk loads.

            Deliberate, and the one user-visible trade in that audit.

            This used to be an <AnimatePresence mode="wait"> wrapping a
            <motion.div key={location.pathname} exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -8 }}>
            with a 0.15s transition. Everything it did was the fade OUT: as the
            original comment recorded, "each page already fades/slides itself in
            via its own `.route-enter` class", and that CSS enter animation is
            untouched and still runs.

            An exit animation genuinely needs JS, because CSS cannot delay an
            unmount - so keeping it meant keeping framer-motion in this file.
            PublicLayout is the layout for EVERY public route, so that single
            import was the last thing pinning the 127KB vendor-motion chunk to
            `modulepreload` on every page load, logged-out visitors included.
            ConfettiBurst (a Konami easter egg), BirthdayPopup and Toast were
            already moved off the eager path; this was the remaining edge.

            150ms of fade-out on the page you are leaving is not worth 127KB on
            the page you are arriving at. Pages now leave instantly and arrive
            with their existing `.route-enter` animation. If it is ever wanted
            back, do it with a CSS view-transition rather than by re-importing
            framer-motion here. */}
