   The companion — changelog/18-mascots-and-motion.md §18.1.

   Replaces the retired `Mascot.tsx` (the abstract "eyes that track the
   pointer" blob, an earlier redesign phase's roaming device). This file
   keeps that component's PROVEN ENGINEERING — the self-stopping motion
   discipline, the overlay-hide via the shared `body.style.overflow==='hidden'`
   signal, waking on demand rather than polling — but the actual MOTION spec
   is new and deliberately calmer than the old one: the old companion always
   chased the live pointer and parked on a CTA; this one is idle by default,
   drifts a short distance along the bottom edge at most once every 45s, and
   only starts trailing the pointer at all once the bone beside it has been
   dragged (or tapped, on phones) off — a session-scoped opt-in, not a
   standing behaviour.

   Renders the REAL cast (`components/Mascot.tsx`, née `AQMascot.tsx`) rather
   than a generic blob, picking a character from the route via the table
   18.0 decided:
     home / feed, onboarding -> nolen   (the default - everywhere else too)
     About                   -> tuk
     auth pages (login/register/callback/pending/rejected) -> bhoot
     404                     -> bhoot   (NotFoundPage marks itself; see below)

// Never on these. /director, /settings, /drive/ match the retired
// companion's own list exactly. /paradox is a deliberate addition: that
// sub-app is "its own visual system entirely" (CLAUDE.md) with its own
// Nav/Footer/AuthProvider/ToastProvider, so a stray companion from the main
// app has no business roaming over it — nothing under paradox/** is touched
// to make this true, it's just one more prefix in this file's own list.
//
// 2026-09-07, adversarial visual review: the AUTH ROUTES are added here as a
// P0 fix. `/login` at 360px was measured with the companion's 44x49 box (plus
// its 58px "DRAG ME" bubble to the left of it) sitting directly on top of the
// three-step explainer - covering "A DIRECTOR APPROVES YOU" and the step-3
// body copy. The existing `denseContentHit` fade below is a mitigation, not a
// guarantee: it polls at 500ms, samples only five points of the companion's
// box, and deliberately ignores plain body text, so it does not catch this.
// The sign-in funnel is the highest-value surface on the site and there is no
// version of "a mascot roams over the sign-up instructions" that is worth a
// conversion; a positional nudge would only move the collision, since it was
// reproduced on three different routes. So: the companion is simply absent on
// the funnel. (`CHARACTER_BY_PREFIX`'s auth -> `bhoot` entries are now
// unreachable and kept only so 18.0's table still reads as written; `bhoot`
