/**
 * The HoD desk's SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for "which desk needs which privilege".
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Before this file the required privilege for a desk was declared TWICE - once
 * as a `<ProtectedRoute requireSuperAdmin>` prop in App.tsx and once as a
 * `superOnly: true` flag in DirectorDashboard's NAV_GROUPS - and a third time,
 * as a hand-copied filter expression, in DirectorLanding. CLAUDE.md records
 * that a drift between the route guard and the nav gate has already shipped as
 * a real privilege bug on this project ("a lower-privileged leader can reach a
 * super-admin-only screen by typing the URL directly").
 *
 * Now every one of those reads from `DESKS` below:
 *   - App.tsx generates its 18 `<Route>`s from it (guard from `privilege`),
 *   - DirectorDashboard's rail and DirectorLanding's desk list both filter
 *     with `isDeskVisible()`,
 *   - deskAccess.test.ts asserts route-guard and nav-gate agree for every
 *     desk × every role, so the historical bug class fails the test run.
 *
 * `privilege` mirrors RLS, not taste (see lib/roles.ts and changelog 11.7:
 * "Mirror the route guard. Never widen it."). Changing a value here changes
 * BOTH gates at once, which is the point - but it is a real access change and
 * must be matched against the database policy for that desk's tables.
 *
 * This file is deliberately pure data + pure functions (no React, no CSS
 * import) so the unit test can import it under vitest's node environment.

 * `wall_notes` ("Removed Notes") was here until 2026-09-11 and is gone -

 *
 * It was a whole nav entry over `profile_notes where deleted_at is not null`,
 * a table holding ZERO rows live. Its own header already conceded the point
 * (§20.2: "a child of post moderation, not a fifth nav group"). Deleted here,
 * in App.tsx's element map, in deskModules' lazy map, and the component file
 * with it. `wallService.listRemoved()` is kept - see the note on it - because
 * the moderation capability is not what was being removed, the DESK was.

 *
 *   · `isSuperAdmin` short-circuits. "super_admin and HR keep the unscoped

 *     and no category assignment must keep the reach they had before scoping
 *     existed - live today that is every non-super leader in the org - because
 *     silently emptying a desk looks exactly like "nobody has applied".
 *   · An item with NO team is out of scope, not in every scope. An opening
 *     that predates the `team_id` FK belongs to no team, and a scoped HoD
 *     seeing it would be seeing something that is not theirs.
