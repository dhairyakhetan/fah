   CONTACT REVEAL, section 13. The audit is the point.

   The Equity Policy's Direct Messaging principle reads "Do not text or call
   another member privately without their prior permission." A leader who
   uncovers one member's phone number for another is granting an exception to a
   written rule, so a reveal is an EVENT, not a free read: it is recorded before
   the value appears, and if the recording fails the value does not appear.

   `contact_access_log` exists live (applied 2026-09-04). Its RLS is
   INSERT where `actor_id = current_member_id()`, SELECT where you are the
   target or you are a leader, and deliberately NO update and NO delete policy:
   a log the actor can edit is not a log.

   The `as any` cast matches `directorService.getMemberDirectory`'s cast on
   `member_directory_view`. NOTE the original reason for it is gone:
   `lib/database.types.ts` was regenerated against the live schema on
   2026-09-12, so the view IS typed now. The cast is kept because the query
   shapes here still differ from the generated Row type, not because the types
   are stale - if you are here to remove it, that is now a safe thing to try.

                    because someone tapped the card on the way to the profile is
                    exactly the accidental audit row this section exists to
                    avoid. Revealing here is always deliberate.

                    ITEM 5.2, owner's decision 2026-09-11: the two contact rows
                    are now COLLAPSED BEHIND A TAP. This reverses the previous
                    decision that they stay visible, and it is the owner's to
                    reverse - the density pass had taken the card to 257px on a
                    375px viewport and reported that the remaining ~215px was
                    content that could not shrink under a 44px tap floor. The
                    contact pair is ~106px of that, so hiding it is the single
                    biggest thing available.

                    What does NOT change: revealing a number is still a
                    deliberate act and still writes a `contact_access_log` row
                    naming the viewer, the member and the time. This adds one
                    tap in front of that; it does not weaken the audit, and the
                    standing notice above the list still says so. */}
