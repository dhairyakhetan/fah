/**
 * The `/director` index route - the cover page of the ledger, not just a
 * counter. It answers three questions before the director picks a tab:
 * who am I acting as, what does the desk look like right now, and what
 * actually needs me today.
 *
 * Redesign 06.4 (2026-09) inverted the DOM order: scope -> title -> triage ->
 * stat strip -> desk list. The stat bento used to sit ABOVE the "what needs
 * you today" card even though four of its six tiles were the same queue
 * counts - an HoD checking between classes read the top of the screen and
 * left. The triage card is now the page's subject. 17.2 (2026-09, on top of
 * 06.4) then replaced the stat strip itself with the jigsaw block below it -
 * see that section's own comment for which of its six planned figures are
 * real.
 *
 * EVERY number here comes from `DashboardStats` (directorService.getDashboardStats)
 * or the layout's category-scoped pending-post count - nothing on this page is
 * invented or approximated. Two figures the redesign wanted (the triage hero's
 * "oldest is N days old" queue age, and a "+N since you last opened" count)
 * are NOT rendered: `getDashboardStats()` returns plain counts with no
 * created-at, and the landing has no list data to derive either from without
 * adding a query - which `WORKFLOW.md` rule 3 forbids ("never add a query to
 * make a design work... omit the element"). Both are logged as unresolved in
 * the build report rather than faked.
 *
 * Enquiries and Hiring used to be omitted from "what needs you today" because the
 * stats service produced no count for them, and inventing one would have been
 * worse than omitting it. They are counted for real now
 * (pendingEnquiries / pendingApplications), so they appear like every other
 * queue - previously those two desks carried no unread signal anywhere in the UI.
