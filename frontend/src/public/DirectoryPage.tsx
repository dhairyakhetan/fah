   SECTION 30 · THE AQ MAP

   Wayfinding, not a feed. Every block on this page is a DOORWAY: it names what
   is behind it, how much of it there is, and where it goes. Nothing here is
   content to be consumed, so nothing here has a like, a save or a body. A
   person should be able to enter at whichever part of AQ they already care
   about, which is why there are four entrances rather than one filter row: a
   filter row assumes you already know what you want, and a map does not.

   FOUR ENTRANCES, in this order: by intent, by department, by kind, by year.

   THE COUNT RULE, which is the rule this page is most likely to be broken by.
   Every figure is in exactly one of three states, and there is no fourth:

     canonical  a figure the org already publishes (AboutPage / orgFacts).
                Rendered as itself. displayCount(ORG_FACTS.drivesWrittenUp) projects,
                8 departments, displayCount(ORG_FACTS.membersTotal) members.
     live       resolved from a `head: true` count query at render. Renders as
                the dashed marker until it lands, then as the number.
     unsourced  no query this public surface can honestly run. Renders as the
                dashed marker PERMANENTLY, and says so to a screen reader.

   A plausible number is never written into this page. `1,247` began life as an
   invented member number on the sign-in receipt and reached seven places before
   anyone checked it; the dashed marker exists so that never has a second cause.

   DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT CATEGORIES. The eight come from `lib/departments.ts` with
   their own literal colour tokens, and route through the five-value category
   vocabulary underneath. Three departments share `labs` and two share
   `operations`; the map says so rather than papering over it. Never colour a
   department through `CAT_COLORS` - five keys cannot serve eight teams, and
   the collision put three on teal and two on grape the last time someone tried.

   This used to print the raw database table name (`welfare_projects`,
   `job_openings`) and, for Labs, a source file path (`public/LabsPage.tsx`,
   which the row truncated on screen to "public/LabsPage.t"). That was schema
   leaking into public UI. `where` names the destination in the site's own
   vocabulary instead.

   correct; do not "fix" it.

   These six strings are duplicated VERBATIM from the `milestones` array in
   `public/AboutPage.tsx`. They are duplicated rather than imported because that
   array is a component-local const in a file this section does not own. If the
   two ever disagree the About page is right and this is wrong. Extracting them
   into a shared module is the correct fix and belongs to whoever owns
   AboutPage.tsx next; until then, changing one means changing both.

   The hue rotation is display-type-only, per the poster system: the year sits
   at 44px and the milestone line beneath it takes solid ink. Every hue used
   here clears 4.5:1 against ink. `--pink-ink` #C4185C, which does not (3.42:1),
