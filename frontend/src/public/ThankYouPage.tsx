/**
 * Confirmation page after an enquiry.
 *
 * Contact and Collaborations already showed an inline success state, which is
 * good UX — it keeps you in place and lets you send another. This does NOT
 * replace that. It exists because an inline state has no URL, and a form
 * submission with no URL of its own is invisible to analytics: there is no
 * distinct page to count, so "how many people actually completed the contact
 * form" was unanswerable.
 *
 * A real route also gives the moment somewhere to say what happens next, which
 * an inline "sent!" line has no room for.
 *
 * `?from=` tailors the copy to the form that sent you. It is presentation
 * only — never trust it for anything that matters, and always fall back to
 * wording that is true whichever form it was.
