/** C01 · full-bleed hero. One post per session earns the loudest shape, so the
    type sits on the photo and the image carries it.

    UNBLOCKED 2026-09-11 (second pass). The chooser still cannot pick this -
    rule 05.1 wants an image ASPECT RATIO and nothing in the corpus stores
    width/height, which is a real limit, not an oversight. What changed is that
    the shape no longer has to come from the chooser: `feedCompose.varyRuns`
    rotates a repeated photo post onto it as a HOST decision, and the host has
    the one fact rule 05.1 was using aspect to approximate - whether this card
    has already spent the loudest shape on the page. The 4/3 container plus
    `object-fit: cover` means a portrait source crops rather than breaking the
    layout, so aspect was never load-bearing for the RENDER, only for the pick.

    Contract fix in the same pass, for the same reason C04 and C06 got one: a
    shape the host may select for a live row must carry the live row's
    behaviour or it silently drops it. So it takes `extras`, splits its own body
    (the live feed leaves `title` unset on purpose - feedItemFromPost.ts), and
    wires onOpen / onOpenAuthor / onOpenImage like the rest of family 05. */

    UNBLOCKED 2026-09-11 (second pass). `feedItemFromPost.ts` already claimed
    this shape was "IN as of 2026-09-11" in prose, but `SHAPED_SHAPES` never
    actually listed it - so every row the chooser sent here fell through to the
    legacy `FeedPostCard` layout and the design simply never appeared on the
    feed. That was the real cause of "I only see 3-4 card designs": the shape
    was being CHOSEN and then thrown away at the dispatcher.

    It was correctly excluded, though, because it dropped `extras` - the six
    host blocks (welfare rail, stat pills, link CTA, documents chip). Fixed
    here rather than by widening the set around a broken card.

    `hueOrInk` falls back to the ink, and `.aqc-block` paints its type ink too,
    so an UNMAPPED category would render ink on ink. The chooser's rule 05.3
    guards that with "mapped category hue"; the host rotation in
    `feedCompose.varyRuns` carries the same guard for the same reason. */

/** C03 · standard photo post. The workhorse. White ground, inset photo, quiet
    meta. Nothing competes with it. Blocked: needs imageCount >= 1 (15.15).

    THREE LAYOUTS, ONE SHAPE (2026-09-18). Measured across all 584 published
    posts, C03 and C02 are 69% of the feed and C02's two caps demote most of
    its share here as well - so this card IS the feed, and one layout for it
    reads as a wall. `varyRuns` cannot help: its ring for C03 is C02/C01/C04
    and a typical row fails `canRender` for all three.

    So the variety lives inside the shape rather than in the chooser. Which
    shape a post gets is already right; what was missing was variety within it.
    That also leaves lib/feedShape.ts untouched, which ACCEPTANCE §E requires.

    The variant is a pure function of the post's own uuid, so the same post is
    the same card for every viewer, on every device, tomorrow as well as today.
