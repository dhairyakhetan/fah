/**
 * The way into the TerraThon desk.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the HoD desk and deliberately not /login. The desk is part
 * of this section: you reach it from the translucent link at the foot of the
 * page, you sign in on a panel that looks like the rest of TerraThon, and you
 * land on a screen that has nothing to do with /director.
 *
 * What is NOT separate is the thing that actually protects the data.
 *
 * The obvious reading of "its own login with a username and password" is one
 * shared password checked in the browser. That was considered and rejected,
 * because of how this app is built: there is no API server, the browser talks
 * to PostgREST directly, and every `terrathon_*` table is gated by RLS on
 * `is_director() or is_super_admin()`. A password checked in JavaScript would
 * have to ship inside the bundle or sit in a readable table, and, much worse,
 * the database would have no way to tell an admin from a stranger, so a few
 * hundred registrants' names and phone numbers would be protected by a modal
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * So this signs a real Supabase session in with email and password. The account
 * is a dedicated TerraThon one rather than anybody's personal login, it carries
 * a leader role so the existing RLS policies recognise it, and the session it
 * creates is what the database checks on every single read. The panel below is
 * convenience; the policies are the boundary.
