/**
 * /dev/desk — the HoD desk preview harness.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, SEPARATELY FROM /dev/authed
 *
 * /dev/authed closed this gap for MEMBER surfaces: the profile nudge, the grid,
 * the compose modal, choose-team. It deliberately stops short of the desk. So
 * the 16 director desks — and in particular the three wide TABLES, which are the
 * hardest thing in this codebase to get right at a phone width — have never been
 * seen rendered by anyone who could not log in as a director. Every spacing and
 * contrast decision on them has been made by reading CSS.
 *
 * That is exactly backwards for a surface whose known failure mode is layout.
 * `director-people.css` carries its own scar from it: a tablet once rendered the
 * desk completely blank because a CSS breakpoint and a JS constant named
 * different widths, and nobody saw it because nobody could look.
 *
 * THE RULES, inherited from /dev/authed and not relaxed:
 *
 *   - **No production component gains a mock code path.** Nothing under
 *     `director/` is edited for this. A file that behaves differently under a
 *     flag is worse than the gap it closes.
 *   - **The swap lives here.** `directorService`'s exported singleton has its
 *     read methods replaced on mount and restored on unmount. The module is
 *     untouched on disk.
 *   - **Writes throw.** Every mutating method is replaced with a rejection, so a
 *     misclick in the harness cannot reach the database. There is no session, so
 *     RLS would refuse anyway; this makes it loud instead of silent.
 *   - **Network is off.** `window.fetch` rejects immediately while this route is
 *     mounted, so a missed seam fails fast rather than reaching Supabase.
 *   - **DEV only.** The route is behind `import.meta.env.DEV` in App.tsx and the
 *     import is inside that branch lexically, so Rollup drops the whole chunk
 *     from a production build.
 *
 * PII: every fixture below is obviously synthetic — `@example.invalid`
 * addresses, `+91 00000 …` numbers, names that read as placeholders. Nothing is
 * copied from the database or from any spreadsheet.
 *
 * THE FIXTURES ARE DELIBERATELY AWKWARD. A row set of tidy short names proves
 * nothing. These include the cases that actually break a table: a name longer
 * than its column, an email longer than any sane column, a member with no
 * avatar, one on a break, one archived, one soft-deleted, and one whose school
 * name is longer than the name itself.

/**
 * The desks are NOT standalone components. Four of them
 * (AccountApprovals, DirectorLanding, HiringResponses, PostModeration) call
 * `useOutletContext()` and destructure `DirectorContext` out of it, because in
 * the real app they are child ROUTES of DirectorDashboard, which supplies it
 * via `<Outlet context={ctx} />`.
 *
 * Mounting one directly throws "Cannot destructure property 'myCategories' of
 * useOutletContext(...) as it is undefined" - which this harness found on its
 * first run, and which is worth stating plainly: the desks have a dependency on
 * their router position that nothing in their own file declares.
 *
 * So the harness reproduces that position rather than faking the hook. A
 * two-level <Routes> gives a real parent whose element renders a real <Outlet>
 * carrying a real context. No production component is touched, and the desks
 * resolve the hook exactly the way they do under DirectorDashboard.

        Resize the window to move between phone, tablet and desktop: the desk
        switches chrome at 1024/1025 and the member table mounts only at 1025 and
        above, so the card grid below that is not a fallback, it is the design.
