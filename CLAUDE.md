# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

AquaTerra is a community platform for a student-run volunteer organization (Kolkata).

- **`frontend/`** — the entire live product. React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, talking **directly to Supabase** from the browser (no API server in the request path). This is the only thing Vercel builds and deploys. (An earlier legacy Express + PostgreSQL `backend/` has been deleted from the repo entirely; `frontend/src/services/api.ts` is type-only — no Axios, no HTTP client — and community services use `supabaseCommunity` directly. Don't try to wire frontend features to a backend API; there isn't one.)
- **Root-level `*.md` files** (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CODING_CONTEXT.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`, `PARADOX_OS_BUILD_LOG.md`, etc.) are point-in-time planning/audit notes from earlier phases of the project. Some describe architecture that was later abandoned (e.g. `ARCHITECTURE.md` proposes Azure AD B2C + JWT; the live app uses Supabase Auth + Google OAuth instead). Don't treat them as current truth — verify against the actual code in `frontend/src`.
- **`docs/PRODUCT_PRD.md`** is the one exception to the above: a living, actively-maintained product PRD (not technical) covering every feature, role, and business rule in the platform, kept current rather than superseded by a new dated file. `docs/SELF_HEALING_ROUTINE.md` describes the recurring review that checks the live product/database against it. Read the PRD before treating a behavior as a bug — check whether it's covered by that doc's "Explicitly not built / retired" section first.

All day-to-day work happens inside `frontend/`.

## Commands

Run from `frontend/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # vite dev server
npm run build        # the real CI/deploy build — see the chain below
npm run lint         # eslint . && the accent-token linter
npm test             # vitest run — 29 files, 710 tests
npm run preview      # preview a production build locally
npm run sitemap      # regenerate sitemap only (scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs)
npm run budget       # bundle-size budget on its own
npm run smoke        # scripts/smoke.mjs
```

`npm run build` is **nine steps, not two**, and any of them can fail the build:

```
lint-accent-tokens → verify-routing → compute-org-facts → generate-sitemap
  → tsc -b → vite build → verify-sitemap → check-bundle-budget → prerender-meta
```

`build:full` is now just an alias of `build`; the sitemap step moved into the
chain. Don't reach for `tsc -b && vite build` by hand and call it verified —
that skips the routing check, the budget and the prerender.

The test layer is real now: **29 files, 710 tests**, covering `lib/roles.ts`,
`lib/capabilities.ts`, `lib/feedShape.ts`, `director/deskAccess.ts`,
`feed/postHeadline.ts` and more. It is still unit-level — pure functions and
pinned contracts, not components — so browser verification remains mandatory
for anything with real runtime behaviour. Run `npm test` and `npm run build`
after a change; a change isn't done until both are clean.

### The accent-lint ledger is keyed by LINE NUMBER

`scripts/accent-lint-baseline.json` records outstanding accent-token violations
as `{file, line, token, …}`. **Insert lines above a tracked rule and the linter
reports it twice** — once as a new violation at its new line, once as a stale
entry at the old one. This has already broken a commit: a 29-line comment added
to `AboutPage.css` moved a tracked rule from 699 to 728 and failed `npm run
lint` for reasons that had nothing to do with the change.

If you edit a file that appears in the ledger, re-point its `line` in the same
commit. The ledger is a debt list, not an exemption model: it must only ever
shrink, and an empty `outstanding` array is the goal.

Deployment is Vercel-only, and only builds `frontend/`:
```json
"buildCommand": "cd frontend && npm install --prefer-offline --no-audit && npm run build",
"outputDirectory": "frontend/dist"
```
`frontend/server.cjs` (Express static-file server with a COOP header for Google OAuth popups) is an alternative non-Vercel way to serve the built `dist/`, not part of the Vercel path.

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, two jobs:

- **`verify`** — the full `npm run build` chain plus `npm run lint` and
  `npm test`. This is the gate.
- **`secrets`** — gitleaks over the **PR range only** (not full history, which
  is known to contain the HR workbook and would fail every run), plus a
  bulk-PII gate that refuses any added `.csv`/`.xlsx` or any file containing
  20+ distinct email addresses.

**Node 22, deliberately.** Not 20: `navigator` only exists as a global from
Node 21, and the build reads it. If you pin a version anywhere, pin ≥22.

`.github/workflows/smoke.yml` is separate and runs `scripts/smoke.mjs`.

### Dev-only preview harnesses

Several routes under `/dev/*` mount real surfaces against fixtures so they can
be designed and debugged without a session or a database:

- **`/dev/desk`** (`dev/DeskSurfaces.tsx`) — mounts six HoD desks with
  fixtures across four scenarios (populated / empty / loading / error). It
  swaps the `directorService` / `certificateService` / `teamService` singletons
  and `supabaseCommunity.from()`, and **disables `fetch` outright**, so nothing
  can reach the network. Four of these desks are child routes that call
  `useOutletContext()`, so the harness reproduces the router position with a
  real two-level `<Routes>` / `<Outlet context>` — mounting them bare throws.
- `/dev/authed` covers member surfaces; `/dev/gallery`, `/dev/variations`,
  `/dev/reencode` cover components, card variants and image work.

These are the fastest way to see a desk, and the only way without credentials.

**They no longer ship.** Each is `import.meta.env.DEV ? lazy(…) : Placeholder`,
so Rollup drops them from the production bundle. An earlier version guarded only
the *route* and left the `lazy(() => import(…))` unconditional, which emitted and
deployed ~57KB of dev chunks. Keep the conditional on the import, not the route.

### Open decisions and their record

`DECISIONS_2026_09_18.md` is the current record of what was decided and what is
still queued. It supersedes the "Your call" track in `AUDIT_2026_09_17.md` and
the open items in `GUARDRAILS_2026_09_18.md`. Check it before re-opening a
question — several long-running items (the `hr`/`super_admin` divergence, the
soft 404, the feed ordering) are settled there.

## Architecture

### Two Supabase projects, three import paths, one codebase

> Corrected 2026-08-10 against the live database. There are **two** projects, not
> three: the "CMS project" below was consolidated into the community project, and
> `lib/supabase.ts` is now literally `export const supabase = supabaseCommunity as any`.
> Only Paradox is genuinely separate. The three numbered entries are kept because
> they still describe the three *import paths* you will meet in the code.

This is the single most important thing to get right before touching data code — mixing these up silently breaks reads/writes.

1. **Community project** (`lib/supabaseCommunity.ts`, client `supabaseCommunity`) — auth, `members`, `posts`, `teams`, `job_openings`/`job_applications`, `notifications`, `saved_posts`, `follows`, `external_achievements`, and (since the projects were consolidated) `welfare_projects` and `blogs` too. Reads env `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
2. **CMS module** (`lib/supabase.ts`, export `supabase`) — historically a *separate* anon-only Supabase project/client for `welfare_projects`/`blogs` with its own never-authenticating client (`persistSession: false, autoRefreshToken: false`). Since the 2026-07 consolidation it no longer creates its own client at all: `supabase` is now literally `export const supabase = supabaseCommunity as any` — a typed-as-`any` **alias of `supabaseCommunity`**, kept only so every existing importer (`cmsSupabase`/`supabaseWelfare` aliases included) keeps working unchanged. Authenticated sessions DO apply to everything imported from this module now — director writes carry the director's real session, and `welfare_projects`/`blogs` RLS gates UPDATE/DELETE on `is_director() OR is_super_admin()` at the database level, not just app routing. The old "`USING (true)` UPDATE/DELETE, enforced only by app routing" trade-off described in `frontend/scripts/welfare_projects_allow_admin_write_2026_07.sql` is obsolete — don't use that file as current RLS truth; check the live policies instead. The module still exists for its shared types/helpers (`WelfareProject`, `Blog`, `normalizeObj`, etc.) and its many importers.
3. **Paradox project** (`paradox/lib/supabase.ts`) — a third, fully separate Supabase project for the annual Paradox event sub-app (`paradox_*` tables). Reads `VITE_PARADOX_SUPABASE_URL`/`VITE_PARADOX_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, falling back to the community project's env vars if unset.

When adding a query, check which client the surrounding file already imports before assuming — `director/*` and most of `services/*.ts` use `supabaseCommunity`; `public/PublicProjectsPage.tsx`, `public/BlogListPage.tsx`, `director/ProjectManager.tsx` use `supabase` (CMS); anything under `paradox/` uses its own client.

### Service layer contract

`services/*.ts` (feedService, teamService, directorService, profileService, followService, savedPostsService, achievementService, notificationService, jobOpenings in `lib/`) **throw on error** — they don't catch-and-toast internally. Every calling component wraps the call in try/catch and is responsible for its own user-facing feedback (see Feedback pattern below). Don't add toast calls inside `services/*.ts` or `lib/jobOpenings.ts` — that responsibility belongs to the component.

`notificationService.create()` is the one deliberate exception — it's fire-and-forget/non-throwing by design (a failed notification shouldn't block the action that triggered it).

### Role model

Five roles, checked via `lib/roles.ts`, not hand-rolled per-file: `member` < `lead` (team-scoped) < `hod`/`director` (equivalent power, different title) < `super_admin`. Use `hasLeaderAccess(role)` for "can moderate/approve" checks and `isSuperAdmin(role)` for the top tier — never add ad-hoc `role === 'hod' || role === 'director'` checks inline. Route-level gating is `ProtectedRoute`'s `requireDirector`/`requireSuperAdmin` props; this must match the equivalent tab-visibility gate in `DirectorDashboard.tsx`, or a lower-privileged leader can reach a super-admin-only screen by typing the URL directly (this has been a real, fixed bug before — always add both when adding a new super-admin-only surface).

Category-scoped moderation also exists: a `director`/`hod` can be assigned to specific categories (`events`/`welfare`/`content`/`operations`/`labs`) via `director_categories`, restricting which posts they can moderate. `directorService.getMyCategories()` / `assignCategory()` / `unassignCategory()`.

### The HoD desk (`director/*`) vs. the public front-end — two design languages, intentionally

The public/member-facing surfaces (`public/*`, `feed/*`, `profile/*`, `teams/TeamsPage.tsx`, most of `teams/TeamDetailPage.tsx`) use the brand's neubrutalist system: hard 2px ink borders, hard offset box-shadows (`Npx Npx 0 0 var(--ink)`), rotated "sticker" badges, bold display type. This is intentional — front-end UI is allowed to trade a little polish for brand personality.

`director/*` (all **17** desks, routed through `DirectorDashboard.tsx`; the count is 9 `leader` + 8 `super` and comes from the one `DESKS` array in `director/deskAccess.ts` — derive it there rather than trusting this sentence) is routed through the same `.admin`-scoped CSS layer (`styles/routes/director.css`, plus the desk's own per-file CSS). Its visual target has now been reversed **twice**, and the current one is the **Sept-2026 “rounded minimalism” handoff** (`interface-redesign-with-rounded-minimalism/project/changelog/`, files `06-hod-desk.md`, `17-desk-nav-and-stats.md`, `20-admin-desks.md`) — **not** the 2026-07 brutalist pass this paragraph used to describe. `06.1` reset the desk tokens to `--hod-border-w: 3px → 1px`, `--hod-border: var(--ink) → rgba(10,10,10,0.12)`, `--hod-radius: 20px → var(--r-outer)` (32px), `--hod-radius-sm: 12px → var(--r-inner)` (22px) and `--hod-shadow: 4px 4px 0 0 var(--ink) → var(--lift-1)`, and `styles/routes/director.css` implements it. So the desk is soft hairline borders, 32/22/14 concentric radii and soft lifts — **do not “restore” 3px ink borders, 20px radii or hard offset shadows here.** The radius scale is 999 / 32 / 22 / 14, with exactly three documented exceptions (the 6px mention mark, the 18px checkbox's 6px corner, and the 6px notched edges on the landing's jigsaw blocks). The token layer (`styles/tokens.css`) is owned by the redesign lead; read it, don't edit it. **If you add a new HoD-desk surface, route its containers through `.card`/`.hod-card` and its rows through the `.panel-h`/`.qrow`/`.qtag`/`.iconbtn` classes** rather than hand-rolling a new style — inline `style` always wins over the cascade, which is exactly what forced several older files (`ProjectManager.tsx`, `TeamManagement.tsx`) to be reworked before. Route↔tab privilege gating (`ProtectedRoute`'s `requireDirector`/`requireSuperAdmin` vs. the `superOnly` flags in `NAV_GROUPS`) mirrors RLS, not taste: change both together or neither.

The `paradox/*` sub-app is its own visual system entirely (heavy `framer-motion` use, own Nav/Footer/AuthProvider/ToastProvider) — don't try to unify it with either of the above.

### Typography — five tokens, and two traps that only show up when rendered

Defined in `styles/tokens.css`. Read it, don't edit it (the token layer is
owned by the redesign lead), but know what each one *is*:

| token | family | what it is for |
|---|---|---|
| `--display` | NeutralFace | headlines, numbers |
| `--sans` | NeutralFace | UI chrome |
| `--mono` | **NeutralFace** | labels, kickers, counts, chips |
| `--eina` | Eina01 | the reading voice, the only real lowercase text face |
| `--serif` | Instrument Serif | italic counterpoint, one word, never a sentence |
| `--code` | JetBrains Mono | the only monospace token |

**`--mono` is NOT monospace.** It was JetBrains Mono until 2026-09-18 and is now
NeutralFace, so the label voice is one family. `--code` is where JetBrains went.
The name is kept because ~550 call sites read it and they are overwhelmingly
uppercase kickers, which is what it now means: a *label*, not a typeface class.

Three measured properties decide where each can go. None of them is visible in
the CSS, and the third has already caused a real regression:

1. **NeutralFace is caps-only.** Its lowercase glyphs are drawn as capitals —
   `"handwriting"` and `"HANDWRITING"` both set to 751px at 100px, ratio 1.000
   (Eina01 gives 563 vs 733). Lowercase text on a NeutralFace token renders
   SHOUTED, and a literal path like `/login` reads as `/LOGIN`.
2. **NeutralFace has no tabular figures.** Under `font-variant-numeric:
   tabular-nums`, `"111"` measures 172px and `"000"` measures 207px: the
   feature is a no-op. JetBrains sets both at 180px and is genuinely tabular.
3. **NeutralFace caps are WIDER than JetBrains at the same size.** This is the
   silent one. Repointing a token can make text stop fitting a box that was
   sized for the old font — the HoD desk's flex-shrunk role select clipped
   `"Member"` to `"ME"`, and nothing in the diff hinted at it.

So the rule is: **reach for `--code` when the glyphs ARE the content**, and
`--mono` when it is a label. `--code` currently carries proper nouns (school
names on member cards), identifiers (routes, slugs, hex, `@handles`, emails),
user-authored body text, live-ticking counters, digit columns that must align,
and `<select>` values (role names carry meaningful mixed case — `"HoD"` is not
`"HOD"`).

`/brand` is the live specimen sheet for all six and documents each by name, so
**it must be updated whenever a token changes** or it starts publishing a lie.

After any font-token change, diff `scrollWidth` against `clientWidth` with each
font applied to the same page. Checking only for case changes misses trap 3.

### Feedback pattern (Toast + Confirm)

Every mutation across the app is expected to: show a pending/disabled state while in flight, a success confirmation on success, and an explicit error (never a silent console log) on failure. The primitives are `useToast()` (`components/Toast.tsx` — `toast.success/error/info`) and `useConfirm()` (`components/Confirm.tsx`, promise-based, used before any destructive action). This is a strict convention, not a suggestion — a PR/change that adds a mutation without wiring both is incomplete by this codebase's own standard.

### Image sizing

Any `<img>` rendering a Supabase/Framer-hosted image must go through `sized(url, context)` from `lib/imageUrl.ts` (`context` ∈ `avatar | thumb | card | cover | full`), which downscales via the CDN's resize param instead of shipping a multi-MB original for a 40px avatar. This has been the single biggest real performance bug found in this codebase historically (the entire `director/*` desk was found and fixed for this once already) — never add a new `<img src={someUrl}>` without wrapping it.

### Front-end motion toolkit

`lib/motion.ts` (shared framer-motion variants: `tapScale` — always `{ scale: 0.96 }`, never lower — `fadeInUp`, `staggerContainer`, `popIn`, `likeBurst`) plus `components/Reveal.tsx` (scroll-reveal, `whileInView`), `components/CountUp.tsx`/`StatCountUp.tsx` (rolling numbers), `components/SuccessCheck.tsx` (self-drawing checkmark for submit-success states) — reuse these instead of re-deriving animation config per file. Front-end only; the HoD desk stays motion-light by the same classification as above. Everything here must honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (via framer-motion's `useReducedMotion()`), matching the existing global CSS `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rules.

### Lazy-loaded director tabs

`DirectorDashboard.tsx` lazy-imports each `director/*` desk component individually so opening the desk doesn't download every tab up front — only the active one. Follow this pattern for any new tab (`const NewTab = lazy(() => import('./NewTab'))`), and add both the `Tab` union member and the route in `App.tsx`'s `/director` route group with matching gating.

### Verify the live schema, not the .sql files (learned the hard way, twice)

Two separate incidents now: `job_applications` was referenced throughout
`lib/jobOpenings.ts` before the table existed live, and — found 2026-08-10 — the
**`members` PII column lockdown had never actually been applied**, leaving 1314
member emails and 37 phone numbers readable by any signed-in account even though
every call site in the app had already been rewritten to work around it. A
checked-in migration whose *code* has shipped is still not evidence the
*migration* ran.

> **STATE AS OF 2026-09-18, verified live.** `members` has **no table-level**
> SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE for `anon` or `authenticated`; privileges are
> column-by-column. Of its 40 columns, `authenticated` may SELECT **32** and is

> `deleted_at`, `deleted_by`, `last_birthday_notice_year`. It may UPDATE 28,
> including `phone` and `guardian_phone` (writable, not readable). `anon` may

Before trusting any schema-level guarantee, check it live:

```sql
-- Authoritative. NOTE: information_schema.column_privileges is NOT reliable
-- here; it only shows rows the querying role granted or received, so a
-- read-only session sees an empty result and reads it as "revoked".
select count(*) filter (where has_column_privilege('authenticated','public.members',column_name,'SELECT')) as readable,
       count(*) filter (where not has_column_privilege('authenticated','public.members',column_name,'SELECT')) as closed
  from information_schema.columns
 where table_schema='public' and table_name='members';   -- expect 32 / 8

-- the table-level grant: `authenticated` must have NO leading `r`
select relacl::text from pg_class where oid='public.members'::regclass;
-- expect {... anon=dDxtm/postgres, authenticated=dDxtm/postgres ...}

-- what does a policy really say?
select policyname, cmd, qual, with_check from pg_policies where tablename='<t>';
```

**Views can bypass all of this.** A `SECURITY DEFINER` view runs as its owner
(`postgres`), so neither column grants nor RLS on the underlying tables apply to
it. That is deliberate for `member_directory_view`, `pending_member_approvals`
and `rejected_member_approvals`, which read revoked columns and gate themselves
inline with `is_director() OR is_super_admin()`. It was a bug in
`post_feed_view`, which had no status filter and therefore served 14
unmoderated posts to anonymous clients until 2026-09-18. **Do not "fix" the
advisor's `security_definer_view` lint by flipping a view to
`security_invoker`** without checking what it reads: doing exactly that to
`pending_member_approvals` is what forced the table-wide grant above. The
correct setting genuinely differs per view.

See `frontend/scripts/security_and_correctness_fixes_2026_08_10.sql` for the
current batch of fixes and whether each has been applied.

### Database migrations are manual, not a runner

There is no migration-runner tooling. Schema changes are checked-in ad-hoc `.sql` files (`frontend/scripts/*.sql`, plus a few at repo root and in `backend/migrations/` from the legacy backend) with a comment block explaining what they do and why, meant to be pasted into the Supabase SQL editor by a human (or applied via the Supabase MCP connector when available in a session). **A `.sql` file existing in the repo does not mean it has been applied** — cross-check against the live schema before assuming a column/table exists (this has caused a real bug: `job_applications` was referenced throughout `lib/jobOpenings.ts` for a long time before anyone noticed the table didn't actually exist in the live database). When you add a schema-dependent frontend change, write the migration file *and* say explicitly whether it still needs to be run.

### Signup/recruitment funnel — Google-OAuth-only, and it works

`public/RecruitmentPage.tsx` no longer exists; `/volunteer/apply` redirects to `/login`. There is no `auth.signUp` call anywhere in the codebase because there doesn't need to be one: a first-time Google sign-in *is* the signup. `AuthContext.fetchMember` finds no `members` row, calls the SECURITY DEFINER `ensure_member()` RPC (see `scripts/community_auth_member_bootstrap_2026_06.sql`, already applied live) which inserts a `pending_approval` row, then routes through `/register` (fills name/class/phone) → `/pending`. `director/AccountApprovals.tsx` → `directorService.approveMember` flips that same auth-linked row's status to `active` — it doesn't need to create an account because one already exists. `director/VolunteerApplications.tsx` is a separate, genuinely unrelated lead-capture desk against the `volunteer_applications` table (WhatsApp-outreach tracking) — don't confuse it with the login path above.

### Terra Notes (`frontend/src/terranotes/`) — the monthly magazine, and AQ Labs inside it

A merged-in sub-app (September 2026) at `/terranotes/*`: JavaScript, inline-styled, no backend, content in
`src/terranotes/data/`. **Read `src/terranotes/README.md` before touching it**; the rules that matter from outside:

- **It draws inside a shadow root** (`TerraNotesRoot.jsx`), on purpose. `styles/v6.css` forces `body`/heading/`p`
  styles with `!important` and would bend a design that relies on browser defaults. Don't "fix" this by removing the
  shadow root, and don't add AQ CSS expecting it to reach in. Its three document-level needs (`@font-face`, `<html>`
  rules, `::view-transition-*`) are in `styles/document.css`, keyed on `html.tn-on`.
- **Its code imports router pieces from `terranotes/router.jsx`, never `react-router-dom`**: that file adds and strips the
  `/terranotes` prefix so the handoff's un-prefixed paths keep working.
- **`App.tsx` uses `AppRouter`, not `<BrowserRouter>`.** Same browser history underneath, wrapped by
  `terranotes/lib/animatedHistory.js` so page changes inside `/terranotes` animate (card flights, crossfades) and
  everything else passes straight through. `useTransitions` is switched off only while a Terra Notes page shows,
  because a view transition needs a synchronous render. Don't swap it back without re-checking the card flight.
- **AQ's nav, mobile dock and footer wrap it** like any public page, and Terra Notes' OWN header (logo, back link, edition
  picker, section links, phone menu button) is hidden: `header.site-header{visibility:hidden}` in `styles/base.css`. It stays in
  the layout as the spacer under AQ's fixed nav (every artboard is positioned against its 64/80px box), so `<main>` takes no
  nav padding on `/terranotes`. `Companion` and `FirstRunController` skip it, `ScrollToTop` leaves scroll to the section; a
  demo tab (`.../demo`) gets no chrome at all. Consequence: the Editions page and the home-section links are no longer in a
  menu; they are reached by scrolling and by address. Add any new global overlay to the skip list.
- **`/labs` and `/labs/:slug` are redirects** into `/terranotes/articles/labs[/chapter]` (client route + permanent
  `vercel.json` redirects). The seven-project `public/LabsPage.tsx` and `labsCohort.mjs` are gone; the sitemap and
  prerender read Terra Notes' data instead (`scripts/terranotes/prerender.mjs`).
- **The top nav pill is now four items** (home / projects / teams / terra notes): the "three items" decision above the
  AQ Labs entry in `AQNav.tsx` was widened on purpose, once, by the owner. It does not open the door to a fifth.
  **The fourth item is time-gated:** it appears in the top pill and the phone tab bar only from 5:45 pm IST on 29 Sep 2026
  (12:15 UTC), via `lib/terraNotesReveal.ts` (`useTerraNotesInNav`). Before then the bar has three items; the route, menus and
  footer are unchanged. Once the date has passed, delete that file and its two call sites so the item just stays.
- **Assets and fonts are local.** Its Google families (latin subsets) are `@font-face` in `styles/document.css`, served from
  `public/terranotes/fonts/g-*.woff2`; nothing calls fonts.googleapis.com at runtime. Article cards load
  `cover-card.webp` (480px) beside `cover.jpg`: run `node scripts/terranotes/tools/make-card-covers.mjs` after adding or
  changing a cover. The page background outside the 1440px artboard is the artboard's own cream (`#F3EEE4`), not the
  handoff's darker `#E6E0D3`, so wide screens show no gutter band. It has no skip link of its own (AQ's targets AQ's
  `<main>`), and Labs' inner `<main>` is a `role="region"` div so there is one landmark. Dialogs (team profile, photo
  viewer) use `lib/useDialogA11y.js`. Looping animations pause offscreen (`lib/pauseOffscreen.js`, `usePauseEach`).
- **Not covered by AQ's tests, eslint, tsc or accent linter** (they skip it; `.d.ts` stubs cover the three seams).
  Verify in a browser at 390 / 1440 (and 320, 1024): phone and web layouts are separate, fixed-width designs.
- **`vercel.json`** gives the Wisdom Woods demo folder `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` (it is iframed by
  `pages/DemoPage.jsx`); `verify-routing.mjs` fails the build if that regresses.

### Mini games (`frontend/src/games/`)

`/games` is a hub and `/games/:slug` one game, code-split per game. **Adding a game is one entry in `games/games.ts` plus its
component**; the hub, the full menu's "mini games" column and the route all read that list (the docblock there shows the
shape). `/games` is prerendered and in the sitemap; `/games/<slug>` is a client route.

### Vercel SPA rewrite — don't point it at `/index.html`

`vercel.json` sets `cleanUrls: true`, which makes Vercel **308-redirect
`/index.html` → `/`**. So the SPA catch-all rewrite must be:

```json
{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
```

…and, since 2026-09-18, it excludes the two static directories:

```json
{ "source": "/((?!assets/|fonts/).*)", "destination": "/" }
```

**Why the exclusion.** Vercel checks the filesystem before rewrites, so a
*present* asset was always served correctly. But a **stale** hashed asset — one
a browser asks for after a redeploy changed the hashes — is no longer on the
filesystem, so the catch-all swallowed it and returned the homepage with
`200 text/html`. A dynamic `import()` of that then fails on the MIME type, which
defeats both retry tiers in `lib/lazyWithRetry.ts`: the 350ms retry re-requests
the same missing file and gets HTML again. Recovery fell through to its third
tier, a full `window.location.reload()` guarded by a 10-second sessionStorage
stamp — so it did recover, but via a visible page reload rather than silently,
and only where sessionStorage is available.

Keep client routes OUT of that exclusion list. `/blog/`, `/projects/`,
`/teams/` and `/labs/` are prerendered directories AND real routes; excluding
them would turn a soft 404 into a hard one on live pages.

If the destination is `/index.html`, the rewrite resolves to a *redirect* rather
than a document and the request falls through to a hard Vercel 404. The failure
is deceptive: the 15 prerendered routes (`about`, `faq`, `teams`, …) keep
returning 200 because Vercel checks the filesystem *before* rewrites, so the site
looks fine — while `/login`, `/director/*`, `/post/:uuid`, `/member/:uuid` and
every other client-only route 404. It presented as "the HoD desk is broken".

Quick check after any routing change:
```bash
for u in / /login /director /post/abc; do \
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} $u\n" https://www.ngoaquaterra.com$u; done
```
All four must be 200.

One consequence worth knowing: because the same catch-all rewrite sends every
unmatched path to `/`, a genuinely nonexistent URL (a typo, a dead link) also
gets a 200 response carrying the homepage, not a true 404 — a "soft 404" to a
crawler. This architecture has no Edge Middleware to inspect the path and
return a real 404 for unknown routes, so this is an accepted trade-off, not an
oversight.
