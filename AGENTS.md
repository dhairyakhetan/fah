# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

AquaTerra is a community platform for a student-run volunteer organization (Kolkata). It has two independent halves that read as one app, plus a legacy piece that is no longer deployed:

- **`frontend/`** — the entire live product. React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, talking **directly to Supabase** from the browser (no API server in the request path). This is the only thing Vercel builds and deploys.
- **`backend/`** — a legacy Express + PostgreSQL API from an earlier architecture (JWT auth, Azure Blob Storage). Not deployed, not in the request path of the live app. `frontend/src/services/api.ts` is explicitly type-only now ("no Axios, no HTTP client — community services use `supabaseCommunity` directly"). Treat `backend/` as historical reference only; don't wire new frontend features to it.
- **Root-level `*.md` files** (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CODING_CONTEXT.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`, `PARADOX_OS_BUILD_LOG.md`, etc.) are point-in-time planning/audit notes from earlier phases of the project. Some describe architecture that was later abandoned (e.g. `ARCHITECTURE.md` proposes Azure AD B2C + JWT; the live app uses Supabase Auth + Google OAuth instead). Don't treat them as current truth — verify against the actual code in `frontend/src`.

All day-to-day work happens inside `frontend/`.

## Commands

Run from `frontend/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # vite dev server
npm run build        # tsc -b && vite build — the real CI/deploy build
npm run build:full   # generates sitemap first, then the same build
npm run lint         # eslint .
npm run preview      # preview a production build locally
npm run sitemap      # regenerate sitemap only (scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs)
```

There is no test suite in this repo (no Jest/Vitest config, no test script) — verification is `tsc -b` (typecheck) + `npm run build` (build must succeed) + manual/browser verification for anything with real runtime behavior. Always run both after a change; a change isn't done until the build is clean.

Deployment is Vercel-only, and only builds `frontend/`:
```json
"buildCommand": "cd frontend && npm install --prefer-offline --no-audit && npm run build",
"outputDirectory": "frontend/dist"
```
`frontend/server.cjs` (Express static-file server with a COOP header for Google OAuth popups) is an alternative non-Vercel way to serve the built `dist/`, not part of the Vercel path.

## Architecture

### Three separate Supabase projects, one codebase

This is the single most important thing to get right before touching data code — mixing these up silently breaks reads/writes.

1. **Community project** (`lib/supabaseCommunity.ts`, client `supabaseCommunity`) — auth, `members`, `posts`, `teams`, `job_openings`/`job_applications`, `notifications`, `saved_posts`, `follows`, `external_achievements`, and (since the projects were consolidated) `welfare_projects` and `blogs` too. Reads env `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
2. **CMS client** (`lib/supabase.ts`, client `supabase`) — historically a *separate* Supabase project for `welfare_projects`/`blogs`; it has since been repointed at the **same** project as `supabaseCommunity` (see `.env.example`'s note: "CMS reads now live in the same Supabase project as community data"). It still exists as a distinct client because it's configured differently — `persistSession: false, autoRefreshToken: false` (it never logs in; every write goes out as the anon key with no auth session). Several `welfare_projects` RLS policies are therefore deliberately `USING (true)` for UPDATE/DELETE — the "only directors can reach this" guarantee is enforced by app routing (`ProtectedRoute`/`hasLeaderAccess`), **not** by the database, for that one table. This is a documented, intentional trade-off (see `frontend/scripts/welfare_projects_allow_admin_write_2026_07.sql`) — don't "fix" it by tightening RLS without understanding this client never authenticates.
3. **Paradox project** (`paradox/lib/supabase.ts`) — a third, fully separate Supabase project for the annual Paradox event sub-app (`paradox_*` tables). Reads `VITE_PARADOX_SUPABASE_URL`/`VITE_PARADOX_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, falling back to the community project's env vars if unset.

When adding a query, check which client the surrounding file already imports before assuming — `director/*` and most of `services/*.ts` use `supabaseCommunity`; `public/PublicProjectsPage.tsx`, `public/BlogListPage.tsx`, `director/ProjectManager.tsx` use `supabase` (CMS); anything under `paradox/` uses its own client.

### Service layer contract

`services/*.ts` (feedService, teamService, directorService, profileService, followService, savedPostsService, achievementService, notificationService, jobOpenings in `lib/`) **throw on error** — they don't catch-and-toast internally. Every calling component wraps the call in try/catch and is responsible for its own user-facing feedback (see Feedback pattern below). Don't add toast calls inside `services/*.ts` or `lib/jobOpenings.ts` — that responsibility belongs to the component.

`notificationService.create()` is the one deliberate exception — it's fire-and-forget/non-throwing by design (a failed notification shouldn't block the action that triggered it).

### Role model

Five roles, checked via `lib/roles.ts`, not hand-rolled per-file: `member` < `lead` (team-scoped) < `hod`/`director` (equivalent power, different title) < `super_admin`. Use `hasLeaderAccess(role)` for "can moderate/approve" checks and `isSuperAdmin(role)` for the top tier — never add ad-hoc `role === 'hod' || role === 'director'` checks inline. Route-level gating is `ProtectedRoute`'s `requireDirector`/`requireSuperAdmin` props; this must match the equivalent tab-visibility gate in `DirectorDashboard.tsx`, or a lower-privileged leader can reach a super-admin-only screen by typing the URL directly (this has been a real, fixed bug before — always add both when adding a new super-admin-only surface).

Category-scoped moderation also exists: a `director`/`hod` can be assigned to specific categories (`events`/`welfare`/`content`/`operations`/`labs`) via `director_categories`, restricting which posts they can moderate. `directorService.getMyCategories()` / `assignCategory()` / `unassignCategory()`.

### The HoD desk (`director/*`) vs. the public front-end — two design languages, intentionally

The public/member-facing surfaces (`public/*`, `feed/*`, `profile/*`, `teams/TeamsPage.tsx`, most of `teams/TeamDetailPage.tsx`) use the brand's neubrutalist system: hard 2px ink borders, hard offset box-shadows (`Npx Npx 0 0 var(--ink)`), rotated "sticker" badges, bold display type. This is intentional — front-end UI is allowed to trade a little polish for brand personality.

`director/*` (all 14 tabs, routed through `DirectorDashboard.tsx`) is still routed through the same `.admin`-scoped CSS layer in `styles/v6.css`, but as of the 2026-07 Codex-design handoff pass its visual target was **reversed**: the desk now matches the handoff's *brutalist* HoD desk (`design-reference/AquaTerra - Playground.dc.html`), not the earlier "flat, calm, boring on purpose" work-tool look. Inside `.admin`, `.card`/`.hod-card` re-tokens to the prototype `.panel` (white surface, **3px** ink border, 20px radius, `overflow:visible`); list rows use the shared `.panel-h` / `.qrow` / `.qname` / `.qsub` / `.qtag` (colored category pill via `--cc`) / `.iconbtn` (`.ok`/`.no`) / `.role-badge` vocabulary, and `DirectorDashboard`'s landing has a dark "command desk." header + solid colored stat cards. The old `--hod-surface/border/shadow/radius` tokens still exist (dark-theme fallbacks, a few calmer surfaces) but the default light-mode desk is brutalist. **If you add a new HoD-desk surface, route its containers through `.card`/`.hod-card` and its rows through the `.panel-h`/`.qrow`/`.qtag`/`.iconbtn` classes** rather than hand-rolling a new style — inline `style` always wins over the cascade, which is exactly what forced several older files (`ProjectManager.tsx`, `TeamManagement.tsx`) to be reworked before. Note the handoff HoD desk is a simplified static mockup; the live tabs deliberately keep richer content (post previews, pagination, role controls, modals) inside the brutalist panel rather than stripping down to the mockup's fake rows.

The `paradox/*` sub-app is its own visual system entirely (heavy `framer-motion` use, own Nav/Footer/AuthProvider/ToastProvider) — don't try to unify it with either of the above.

### Feedback pattern (Toast + Confirm)

Every mutation across the app is expected to: show a pending/disabled state while in flight, a success confirmation on success, and an explicit error (never a silent console log) on failure. The primitives are `useToast()` (`components/Toast.tsx` — `toast.success/error/info`) and `useConfirm()` (`components/Confirm.tsx`, promise-based, used before any destructive action). This is a strict convention, not a suggestion — a PR/change that adds a mutation without wiring both is incomplete by this codebase's own standard.

### Image sizing

Any `<img>` rendering a Supabase/Framer-hosted image must go through `sized(url, context)` from `lib/imageUrl.ts` (`context` ∈ `avatar | thumb | card | cover | full`), which downscales via the CDN's resize param instead of shipping a multi-MB original for a 40px avatar. This has been the single biggest real performance bug found in this codebase historically (the entire `director/*` desk was found and fixed for this once already) — never add a new `<img src={someUrl}>` without wrapping it.

### Front-end motion toolkit

`lib/motion.ts` (shared framer-motion variants: `tapScale` — always `{ scale: 0.96 }`, never lower — `fadeInUp`, `staggerContainer`, `popIn`, `likeBurst`) plus `components/Reveal.tsx` (scroll-reveal, `whileInView`), `components/CountUp.tsx`/`StatCountUp.tsx` (rolling numbers), `components/SuccessCheck.tsx` (self-drawing checkmark for submit-success states) — reuse these instead of re-deriving animation config per file. Front-end only; the HoD desk stays motion-light by the same classification as above. Everything here must honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (via framer-motion's `useReducedMotion()`), matching the existing global CSS `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rules.

### Lazy-loaded director tabs

`DirectorDashboard.tsx` lazy-imports each of the 14 `director/*` tab components individually so opening the desk doesn't download every tab up front — only the active one. Follow this pattern for any new tab (`const NewTab = lazy(() => import('./NewTab'))`), and add both the `Tab` union member and the route in `App.tsx`'s `/director` route group with matching gating.

### Database migrations are manual, not a runner

There is no migration-runner tooling. Schema changes are checked-in ad-hoc `.sql` files (`frontend/scripts/*.sql`, plus a few at repo root and in `backend/migrations/` from the legacy backend) with a comment block explaining what they do and why, meant to be pasted into the Supabase SQL editor by a human (or applied via the Supabase MCP connector when available in a session). **A `.sql` file existing in the repo does not mean it has been applied** — cross-check against the live schema before assuming a column/table exists (this has caused a real bug: `job_applications` was referenced throughout `lib/jobOpenings.ts` for a long time before anyone noticed the table didn't actually exist in the live database). When you add a schema-dependent frontend change, write the migration file *and* say explicitly whether it still needs to be run.

### Out of scope / known-severed area

The recruitment → account-creation funnel (`public/RecruitmentPage.tsx`, `director/AccountApprovals.tsx`, `directorService.approveMember`, and the `volunteer_applications` ↔ `members` relationship) is known to be severed — there's no `auth.signUp` in that path currently. This is being handled separately; don't "fix" it incidentally while working on something else in that area.
